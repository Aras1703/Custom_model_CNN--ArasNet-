# Custom_model_CNN--ArasNet-
in this case, i used a PyTorch library to take the MNIST dataset from "torchvision.dataset" function. To preprocessed the data i just normalizing the dataset and change it to Tensor from NumPy array. Then, i build my own model named Aras Net. Aras Net is a model that based on CNN, i use some function like Convolution, Pooling, and Padding from CNN. Furthermore, after the Convolution, Pooling, and Padding process i used a batch normalization function to normalizing the weighted in fully connected layer. Aras Net get 99,03 % accuracy in just 3 iteration.
